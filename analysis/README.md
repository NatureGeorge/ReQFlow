# Guidance to Evaluation
To evaluate the generation, we use designability, diversity and novelty. Here is the way to calculate these metrics from inference output.

## Install tools
We use Foldseek in our evaluation. Follow the instructions to install it.

### Install FoldSeek

FoldSeek is used to evaluate novelty: search for simular protein. Github repo: https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek

To start with, follow the instruction in the github page. Check using means of you see `avx2` in the output, your device supports `avx2`. Using `avx2` is recommended if your device supports `avx2` and `sse2` simutaniously.

```
# Linux AVX2 build (check using: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep avx2)
wget https://mmseqs.com/foldseek/foldseek-linux-avx2.tar.gz; tar xvzf foldseek-linux-avx2.tar.gz; export PATH=$(pwd)/foldseek/bin/:$PATH

# Linux SSE2 build (check using: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep sse2)
wget https://mmseqs.com/foldseek/foldseek-linux-sse2.tar.gz; tar xvzf foldseek-linux-sse2.tar.gz; export PATH=$(pwd)/foldseek/bin/:$PATH

# Linux ARM64 build
wget https://mmseqs.com/foldseek/foldseek-linux-arm64.tar.gz; tar xvzf foldseek-linux-arm64.tar.gz; export PATH=$(pwd)/foldseek/bin/:$PATH

# MacOS
wget https://mmseqs.com/foldseek/foldseek-osx-universal.tar.gz; tar xvzf foldseek-osx-universal.tar.gz; export PATH=$(pwd)/foldseek/bin/:$PATH

# Conda installer (Linux and macOS)
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda foldseek
```

To start, create the database. It will download files from https://www.rcsb.org. Here, `tmp` is a temp folder, and the files will be downloaded to the parent folder of `tmp`. 
I will use `path/to/FoldSeek_PDB_Database` as example.Get to the parent folder (Remember this folder, useful later!)

```
cd path/to/FoldSeek_PDB_Database
```

And create database. `PDB` is the name for database, `pdb` is a 'nickname' (will be used in `All_Metric_Calculation.py` as `database`). `tmp` is the folder to store temp file.

```
foldseek databases PDB pdb tmp 
```
then run
```
foldseek
```
If you see the information of foldseek, congratulations!

## Start Evaluation

`All_Metric_Calculation.py` is designed for calculate the metrics. Start via running:

```
cd ReQFlow
python analysis/All_Metric_Calculation.py --inference_dir path/to/dir  --script_path abs/path/to/run_foldseek_parallel.sh  --dataset_dir /path/to/FoldSeek_PDB_Database
```
The script requires several command-line arguments for configuration.  Here's a breakdown:
+ `--inference_dir` (Required): The directory containing the inference results from QFlow. e.g. `path/to/ReQFlow/Inference_Results/15D_11M_2024Y_12h_00m_52s`
+ `--script_path` (Required): The *ABSOLUTE* path to the `run_foldseek_parallel.sh` script. e.g. `path/to/ReQFlow/analysis/run_foldseek_parallel.sh`
+ `--dataset_dir` (Required): The directory containing the FoldSeek dataset as mentioned in Foldesek installation. e.g. `path/to/FoldSeek_PDB_Database`
+ `--database` (Optional): The database to use for FoldSeek (e.g., pdb). Defaults to pdb. 
+ `--type` (Optional): Type of evaluation (qflow, FrameFlow, FoldFlow, FrameDiff, Genie2, RFdiffusion)). Defaults to qflow.

**Notice**, to avoid potential issues, the script would delete unrelavent files in inference directory ('Reset' the folder). 
Besides, running foldseek would use a huge amount of CPU cores. By default, the script utilize 50% of all cores. You can modify in line 101 of `run_foldseek_parallel.sh`.

The script will generate some files. Important ones include: 

0. `Metrics.txt`, the final results. Most important. 
1. `All_Results_Origin.csv`, containing all original infomation (e.g. length, modeled pdb path, rmsd, tm-score, ESMF path)
2. `All_Sampled_PDB.txt`, containing all pdbs generated by model. Mainly use for `maxclustering` and `foldseek`.
3. `All_Sampled_PDB_Designable.txt`, similar to former but only contains designable ones.
4. `All_Sampled_PDB_and_Length.csv`, containing length and pdbs. Use for concate.
5. `All_Sampled_PDB_and_Length_Designable.csv`, similar to former but only contains designable ones.
6. `Average_Times_per_Sample.png`, a visualization of sampling time.
7. `summary_tmscore.csv`, generated by FoldSeek, the max tm-score between give protein and which in pdb database.
